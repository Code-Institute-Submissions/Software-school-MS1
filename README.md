## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

Software School is an education and mentoring business that offers courses to study in classrooms and online. And conferences is also offered at, for example, trade fairs and companies for skills development.
It was created by a student who studies at the Code Institute and who has ambitions to become a Software Developer.
The content creator knows how important it is to study in the right way and in a flexible environment when needed.

*This site has been created for a school business project and for the exercise purposes. 
This is my first project for the Code Institute Diploma in Full Stack Development.*

## UX <a name="ux"></a>

My goal was to have an intuitive, professional and stylish website. Since all content is on one page, the main function is to easily
access the sections and navigate to the contact form, to contact the content creator. The navigation bar is looking simple and clean, and takes you to different parts of the page in one click.
The appearance of the page looks the same from top to bottom.
